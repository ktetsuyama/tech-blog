## Introduction

As a developer who writes about tech, the client wants a CMS-style blog site
so that they can publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts and opinions

## Problem

The developer needs a front-end and a back-end to a blog site, that allows users to login, create posts, and comment on other's posts.

## Solution

I repurposed a basic website to suit the client's needs. This website utilizes a lot of the structure of a provided mini-project, but adjusted to serve the client's needs.

Here is a video of the application in action:

## Contributors

I used the mini-project for week 14 (Crowdfunding App) to complete this application, and I used phind.com to help with debugging.
